Market

The primary market for UniBiz is university students and young adults within campus communities who seek convenient access to essential services without leaving their campus environment, as well as student entrepreneurs.

Habit

UniBiz is designed for intermittent use, based on student needs such as weekends, before major campus events, or daily for services like home-cooked meals. It is a valuable tool for students looking for convenient, reliable services on campus.

Scope

Initially, UniBiz will focus on facilitating connections for services like hairdressing, cooking, and other essential campus-related services. It will allow for profile creation, service listings, booking functionalities, and reviews.
